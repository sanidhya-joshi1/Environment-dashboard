## ✨ Features

- 📊 **Multi-parameter Dashboard** → Monitor temperature, humidity, CO₂, UV index, wind speed, and more  
- ⏱️ **Real-time Simulation** → Auto-updates every few seconds with randomized data  
- 🖱️ **Interactive Cards** → Each metric displayed in a clean, card-based UI  
- 📱 **Responsive Design** → Works seamlessly on desktop & mobile

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Data**: Mock/simulated data (no backend)  
- **Design**: Card-based responsive layout

## ⚙️ How It Works

- All logic runs **entirely in the browser** using `index.js`  
- Metrics are **randomly generated** to simulate live data  
- **No backend/server required** → Just open in your browser and go

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sanidhya-joshi1/Environment-dashboard.git
   cd Environment-dashboard

2. Open index.html in your browser

No build step required

All dependencies included in the repo

📁 File Structure
Environment-dashboard/
├── index.html   # Loads the dashboard
├── index.js     # Logic for rendering & data simulation
└── style.css    # Styling for dashboard & cards

🎨 Customization

Adjust data ranges inside index.js for temperature, humidity, etc.

Replace simulation logic with API calls to connect real sensors or backend data.

🔮 Future Enhancements

 Add real sensor data via APIs

 Integrate backend (FastAPI/Node.js)

 Advanced chart visualizations (D3.js / Chart.js)

 Export data as CSV/PDF
